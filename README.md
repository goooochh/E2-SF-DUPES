Hello there.

This repository will be an archive for some StarfallEx, E2, ADV2 dupes files.

## How to upload txt files into GMod?

- You have to go by these directions:
  1. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\advdupe2
  2. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\expression2
  3. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\starfall

  And put there the files.

## Hey-hey! It's MY chip(or dupe) and i DO NOT want to see it here!

Open an Issue and i'll delete it from here.
